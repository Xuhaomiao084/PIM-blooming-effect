PIM is process in memory and blooming effect is a crucial problem in lidar area.

This project applies PIM to create 40 cores alone with 40 pieces of memory. This helps deal with the data parallelly and largely increase the efficiency.

The project uses VCS to simulate and Verdi to visualize the waveform. Makefiles are included to help run the environment.
